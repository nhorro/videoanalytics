The pipeline paradigm
=====================

This module contains the building blocks for implementing the pipeline paradigm.
This implementation defines two concepts:

    - **Sources**: components that acquire data from a device such as a camera or file.
    - **Sinks**: components that process previously generated data. Their output can be additional information  available to other component or an action, as publishing data to a DB or communication middleware.

Pipelines are chained components that perform succesive steps in order to obtain a final product. 
Each pipeline is composed of **only one source** of information and one or more **sinks** that 
perform operations.

Pipelines are not restricted to video frames, but to keep things simple we will be assuming that 
each unit of information is a video frame.
