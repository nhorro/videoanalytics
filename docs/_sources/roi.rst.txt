ROIs (regions of interest)
==========================

Regions of interest are polygonal areas which can be tested for the presence of objects or other events
such as:

- If an object enters or leaves a region.
- The time an object stays inside a region.
- The number of objects in a region.
- The amount of movement or activity inside a region.
- Etc.

Combined with the information from an object detector, an object tracker, or motion estimation,
ROIs can provide useful insights of what is happening in a scene.
