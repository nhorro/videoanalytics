# videoanalytics

Python library for prototyping of video analytic applications. Relies on OpenCV, Keras, and other standard AI python packages.

References:
- Code for YOLOv4 and DeepSORT was adapted from [yolov4-deepsort](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort).

## Instructions for developers

Import conda environment:

~~~bash
conda env create -f videoanalytics-gpu.yml
~~~

Some examples are provided as jupyter notebooks.

~~~bash
conda activate videoanalytics-gpu.yml
jupyter notebook .
~~~

## Component reference

Components are organized as Sources and sinks which are instanced and connected at execution time as pipelines.
Sources consume data from a camera or file and trigger the processing pipeline.
Sinks process data that was made available from other components and generate new.
